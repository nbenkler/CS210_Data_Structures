# Coursework

## Assignment_1

#### Exercise targeted at:
  + Writing a simple-but-not-trivial Java program.
  + Practicing using ArrayList.
  + Practicing organizing your code modularly.
  + Practicing thinking about your program's essential data, and how to use classes to cleanly encapsulate the data.
  
#### Important Files:
  + Person.java   -- Class used by PeopleSorter to extract information about People to be sorted 
  + PeopleSorter.java -- Code for sorting input using arraylists
  + people.txt -- people used in program
  
## Assignment_2

#### Exercise targeted at:
  + Learning how to manipulate simple linked structures.
  + Continue practicing core Java constructs like loops, conditionals, methods, and types.
  
#### Important Files:
  + LinkedList.java  -- code file to implement and explore linkedlists assignment
  
## Assignment_3

#### Exercise targeted at:
  + Getting more Java practice, with emphasis on reading and parsing input from a file
  + Practice adhering to a specification
  + Using a stack to solve a non-trivial problem.
  + Implementing a classic example of a backtracking algorithm.
  + More Java practice.
  
#### Important Files:
  + Maze.java  -- code file for creating maze from text document
  + maze.txt   -- txt file denoting parameters for maze

## Assignment_4

#### Exercise targeted at:
  + Experimenting with multiple implementations of a single interface.
  + Learning how the Java interface keyword works.
  + Practicing comparing the time complexity of different implementations of the same method interface.
  + Practicing expressing those time complexities in Big O notation.

#### Important Files:
  + CarlStack.java  --  interface used by other .java files in assgnment

  + CarlStackALBad.java -- Class using Arraylist poorly to push, peek, pop, etc.
  + CarlStackLL.java  --  Class using LinkedList to push, peek, pop, etc.
  + CarlStackTester.java -- Tests quality and speeds of different implementations of CarlStack.java
  + interfaces.pdf  --  text document answering questions on and thinking about the assignment

## Assignment_5

#### Exercise targeted at:
  + Implementing and understanding a few simple search algorithms.
  + Getting better acquainted with generics and interfaces in Java.
  
#### Important Files:
  + SearchableCollection.java -- An interface for use with the exploration of search algorithms in other .java files
  + BinarySearchableCollection.java -- Implementation of SearchableCollection interface, for use in binary search algorithms.
  + LinearSearchableCollection.java -- Example implementation of SearchableCollection interface, for use in linear search algorithms.
  + Person.java -- object that supports comparison to String search key, where the comparison is between the search key and the Person object's family name.
  +SearchTimer.java  --  A demonstration of simple timing code for binary and linear searching algorithms.
  +sowpods.txt -- a sorted list of all the words in the english language
  +searchreport.pdf -- report on observations of how the code ran and timing data
  +data1.csv -- timing data taken from SearchTimer.jave running Linear and BinarySearchableCollection.java N number of times
